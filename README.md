# Hi, I‚Äôm @Skunsara

üëÄ **I'm interested in:** Collaborative projects centered around mainframe engineering, z/OS system administration, and large-scale enterprise computing.

üå± **I‚Äôm currently learning:** Advanced concepts in IBM z/OS, including system programming, REXX scripting, and mainframe security protocols.

üíûÔ∏è **I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on:** Projects involving mainframe environments, specifically in z/OS system setup, automation, and exploring new technologies and AI applications in enterprise computing. I am also interested in innovative uses of mainframe technologies in modern computing contexts.

üîê **Recent Projects:**

- [**Secure Server Deployment:**](https://github.com/Skunsara/Secure-server): Involved in closing unnecessary ports, identifying and exploiting SQL injections, and providing detailed security recommendations.
- [**Network Project**](https://github.com/Skunsara/Network-Project): Contributed to Apache server configuration for optimized performance and security, implemented MFA for SSH connections, and changed default SSH ports.
- [**Secure Web Application Project**](https://github.com/Skunsara/Secure-Web-Application-Project): A project focusing on the security of web applications.
- [**Pfsense Projetct Firewall**](https://github.com/Skunsara/Pfsense-Project): The project is an exploration into the creation of a secure, isolated, and configurable network environment suitable for testing
- [**Active Directory Project**](https://github.com/Skunsara/Active-Directory-Projet): This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up an Active Directory lab environment on your personal computer using VirtualBox. The lab consists of a domain controller and a Windows 10 client, both configured to communicate within a virtual network. This environment enables experimentation with Active Directory features, Windows networking, and various administrative tasks.
- [**Glpi Project**](https://github.com/Skunsara/Glpi-Project): This guide provides detailed instructions for installing and configuring GLPI (IT and asset management software) on a Debian-based system.
