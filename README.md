# Hi, I’m @Skunsara

👀 **I'm interested in:** Collaborative projects based on cybersecurity, and network administration.

🌱 **I’m currently learning:** More about server security, penetration testing, and network configuration.

💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on:** Projects involving setting up virtual machines for server deployment, conducting in-depth server pentests using tools like BurpSuite, Nmap, Metasploit, and various injection techniques.

🔐 **Recent Projects:**

- [**Secure Server Deployment:**](https://github.com/Skunsara/Secure-server): Involved in closing unnecessary ports, identifying and exploiting SQL injections, and providing detailed security recommendations.
- [**Network Project**](https://github.com/Skunsara/Network-Project): Contributed to Apache server configuration for optimized performance and security, implemented MFA for SSH connections, and changed default SSH ports.
- [**Secure Web Application Project**](https://github.com/Skunsara/Secure-Web-Application-Project): A project focusing on the security of web applications.
- [**Pfsense Projetct Firewall**](https://github.com/Skunsara/Pfsense-Project): The project is an exploration into the creation of a secure, isolated, and configurable network environment suitable for testing
- [**Active Directory Project**](https://github.com/Skunsara/Active-Directory-Projet): This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up an Active Directory lab environment on your personal computer using VirtualBox. The lab consists of a domain controller and a Windows 10 client, both configured to communicate within a virtual network. This environment enables experimentation with Active Directory features, Windows networking, and various administrative tasks.
